Puzzle solutions of Advent Of Code

Advent of Code defines itself as: "An Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like."

You can find more information or give it a try yourself here: <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">adventofcode.com</a>

Every year, 50 new puzzles are made public for you to solve. Every participant has individual input data and unique solutions, that's why even though you may share the code you used to solve a puzzle, you should not share the input data you had.
